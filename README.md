# Datascriptor-Website

## Installation

Use Jekyll to build/serve the site. If you have rvm installed and working 
(see https://github.com/FAIRsharing/rails_graphql_prototype) then you should
be able to follow the instructions here:

https://jekyllrb.com/

...simply `bundle exec jekyll serve` should do it.


The actual site is in `_site` and this can be rsynced to the appropriate directory on the 
relevant server.
